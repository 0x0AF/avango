To start an example, first set search path for example shaders:

export SHADE_SHADER_PATH=$PWD/examples/

Also, if the library is not yet installed, the standard shaders need to be 
added to the search path as well:

export SHADE_SHADER_PATH=$PWD/examples/:$PWD/lib/shade/

Then simply run the example by running the executable. The current directory 
should be top-level directory of the library.
