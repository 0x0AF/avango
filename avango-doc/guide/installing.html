<h1>Installing Avango</h1>

<h3>Installing Avango Run-time Environment</h3>
If you would like to run a specific Avango application or perform benchmarking tests, you could download the self-installing 
Avango Run-time Environment. The following examples are included into the package: <p class=todo>TBA</p>
The Windows version is available here: <p class=todo><a href="http://avango.org/avango-win-installer">http://avango.org/avango-win-installer</a>.</p>


<h3>Installing Avango Development Environment</h3>
For Avango developers working under Windows, it is recommended
to compile Avango locally with Microsoft Visual Studio. <br><br>

This can be done in the following steps. <br><br>

<b>1. Installing prerequisites</b><br>
The following software modules have to be downloaded, installed and configured prior to Avango
compilation:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/default.aspx">Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 or 2008</a> (also known as VS 8 and VS 9)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.python.org/download/">Python programming language</a> 2.5 or later</li>
<li><a href="http://www.scons.org/download.php">scons build system</a> 1.0.0 or later</li>
<li><a href="http://www.boost.org/">boost C++ library</a> 1.35 or later. It is recommended to select all variants all the library for Visual Studio 2005</li>
<li><a href="http://www.openscenegraph.org/projects/osg">OpenSceneGraph 3D graphic toolkit</a> 2.6.0 or later. It is also recommended
to compile the toolkit locally. To do that one should download and install <a href="http://www.cmake.org">Cmake</a> (version 2.4.6 or later),
download the <a href="http://www.openscenegraph.org/projects/osg/wiki/Downloads/Dependencies">prebuilt dependencies</a>,
include their bin directory to the system's PATH variable and configure and compile OpenSceneGraph following the instructions
of the README.txt in its root directory.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<b>2. Configuring paths</b><br>
Include the locations of Python, Python/scripts, OpenSceneGraph/bin to the system's PATH environment variable.
Include the locations of OpenSceneGraph/lib and OpenSceneGrpah/include to the Visual Studio library and include directories.
<br><br>
<b>3. Downloading and Compiling Avango</b><br>
Avango source code can be downloaded using an SVN client (such as <a href="http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/">TortoiseSVN</a>)
from the following address: <a href="">http://avango.org/svn/trunk</a>.
<br> <br>
You have the following possibilities of compiling Avango:
<ul>
<li>Open the supplied solution file avango.sln and build the project in the Visual Studio 2008
<li>Create a new project from existing code in the Visual Studio:
	<ul>
	<li>Select the menu "File -> New -> Project from Existing Code"
	<li>Select the directory in which you sources for avango for Windows reside.
	<li>Enter the project name
	<li>Select "Use external build system"
	<li>As build command, enter the scons command
	<li>Build the solution  
</ul>
<li>Build Avango modules from the Visual Studio command prompt:
	<ul>
	<li>Open the Visual Studio Command prompt
	<li>Go to the location where the top level SConstruct file resides.
	<li>Enter the scons command (you can also build only selected modules by providing the module
            name after the scons command, e.g. scons core, scons osg, scons python, scons unittest, etc) 
</ul></ul>

In case the compilation was successfull, you should be able to start the SnowLand example (it is located in TBA). <br><br>

In order to be able to use the built dlls (e.g. to "import avango" into a python application), the so-called manifest
file has to be included into the dll. The command for an executable is
<blockquote>
mt.exe -manifest MyApp.exe.manifest -outputresource:MyApp.exe;1
</blockquote>
for a dll it is
<blockquote>
mt.exe -manifest MyLibrary.dll.manifest -outputresource:MyLibrary.dll;2 
</blockquote>
