<h1>Input in AVANGO</h1>

Most interaction devices belong to one of the following categories:
<ul>
<li>gloves/hand masters
<li>mice and joysticks
<li>remote controls/wands
<li>force/space balls.
</ul>

Input devices may be described by the follows characteristics:
<ul>
<li>Degrees-of-freedom (DOF) of an input device. Many devices supported by tracking systems have 6 DOFs (3 for position and 3 for orientation).
<li>Number and type of buttons and controls.
<li>Compatibility with interaction tasks.
<li>Presence of feedback channels (sound, vibration etc).
<li>Other specific characteristics: it may be one- or two-handed device, wireless or wired device and so on.
</ul>

Currently, AVANGO supports the following input devices:

<ul>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii_Remote">Nintendo's Wii Remote</a>. It has motion sensing capability
through the use of accelerometer and optical sensor technology,
provides basic audio and rumble functionality, and supports Bluetooth.
In the Virtual Relaity laboratory of Fraunhofer IAIS the device
was integrated with passive markers that allows tracking its position
and orientation (6DOF) with the help of the infrared tracking system
developed by <a href="http://www.ar-tracking.de/">AR-tracking</a>.
<li>PioDA. It is a combined 3D interaction device for virtual environments.
Similarly to Wii Remote, PioDA with the AR-tracking system. The device is PDA-based.
It is used as a 6DOF interaction device with portable graphical user
interface for application/system control in virtual environments.
It integrates wireless optical tracking (room-size) and is useful for
most projection based virtual environments. Having only one handy device
for both interaction and application/system control is the major advantage
of this device. The GUI of the device can display interactive content,
which can be synchronized with the context of a VR application.
<li>NoYo. It is a joystick-like handheld input device for travel
and rate-controlled object manipulation. NoYo combines a 6DOF elastic
force sensor with a 3DOF source-less isotonic orientation tracker.
This combination allows consistent mapping of input forces from local
device coordinates to absolute world coordinates, effectively making
NoYo a "SpaceMouse to go". The device is designed to allow one-handed
as well as two-handed operation, depending on the task and the skill
level of a user.
</ul>

If you would like to connect your own input device with AVANGO,
you should use the methods of the <a href="avango-daemon.html">avango-daemon</a> class
to access the device's parameters, and the methods of the <a href="avango-daemon.html">avango-tools</a>
class to connect them with specific interaction tools.
In particular, if you device is tracked, you have to create an AVANGO
matrix describing its poition and orientation for the device. <span class="todo">An example will be added
here later</span>.

<br><br>Some AVANGO applications also support speech and gesture input. The modules
will be integrated into AVANGO at a later time.
