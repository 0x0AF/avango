Various application fields that already use immersive interaction have different display system
requirements. Different screen sizes, resolutions, and 3D viewing technologies exist.
For example, a presentation environment for groups of people needs to satisfy different
demands as opposed to an interactive training environment designed for a specific scenario.
The result is a relatively large number of available display system configurations, most of which
are based on the same principle: projection of a stereo image pair onto a large screen.

<br><br>
The most important characteristic of a display system is the used technology to generate a 3D impression.
The most common systems are:
<ul>
<li>Passive stereo systems. Images rendered by the computer are projected for the left and right eye
    in perpendicular polarization and respective polarization glasses are required to get the 3D effect.
    For each eye, a separate projector is needed.
<li>Active stereo systems. The rendered images are projected in sequence for left and right eye and special
    shutter glasses are used to get the 3D effect. The glasses are see-through so that a user could perceive
    the virtual environment as being integrated in his or her normal environment; the glasses are synchronized
    with the projectors on infrared channel. Only one active-stereo-capable projector is needed per screen.
<li>The Infitec (color separation) system  separates the stereo image pair by using different, complementary 
    spectra of lights for both eyes. The crosstalk is very small. However, because of the different
    wavelength triples used for both eyes, slight deviations of colors are noticeable.
<li>Autostereoscopic displays. Such systems do not require stereo glasses, since they separate
    the images for both eyes on the display surface using layers of masks and lenticular optics.
    This causes different images to be seen from different viewing angles, and consequently,
    the user can perceive a 3D effect when viewing from the corresponding sweet spot.
<li>Quasi-holographic displays. Consisting of optical modules, like projectors and mirrors,
    and a holographic screen, this innovative kind of display system is capable of generating a
    true 3D effect without using auxiliary means, such as glasses. The holographic screen emits
    light beams received from the optical modules under different angles as if they were emitted
    from real artifacts.
<li>Light-field displays - true 3D displays that does not require stereo glasses. They are constructed
    using a high-speed projector and a spinning reflective device that is synchronized with the projected
    image sequence. In this way it is possible to project multiple center-of-projection images.
    The reflecting device behaves like a mirror horizontally, allowing a 360 degrees field of view and
    scatters vertically.
</ul>

Currently, AVANGO supports the following display systems:
<ul>
<li>The i-Cone display system. It was developed by the Virtual Environments dept. of the Fraunhofer IAIS.
    It is a full-immersive projection system, which uses direct seamless projection of active stereo images
    onto a wide (230 degrees) cylindrical screen. The system has a slightly slanted projection area,
     forming a cone-shaped display, in order to
    minimize disturbing echoes perceivable at the centre of the system. Another positive
    effect of the slanting is that front projection can be used in a way that shadow casting
    by viewers is reduced. The height of the screen is 2,8m, lower edge curvature's radius is
    2,96m, upper - 3,3m. The full size of an image rendered by 4 projecttors is 5760 x 1320 pixels.
<li>The TwoView display system. This is also a full-immersive projection system with back-projections
    of active stereo images onto the screen and the floor. Normally, in projection based VEs, only one user
    is head-tracked and can see perspectively correct. All other users wearing
    stereo glasses see a stereo image computed for a different centre of projection,
    which is distorted. The TwoView display developed by the Virtual Environments dept. of the Fraunhofer IAIS
    removes this limitation and supports two head tracked users. Because of correct perspective,
    the virtual and physical spaces are correctly aligned for both users allowing true co-located
    collaborative work with 3D objects. The image pairs of the two users are separated
    using polarization, whereas stereo is achieved by shuttering (active stereo).
    This means that polarization filters need to be mounted to the shutter glasses,
    and two active-stereo capable projectors are needed
</ul>
