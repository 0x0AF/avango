 various devices (sensors, data gloves, haptic devices) in a local or distant 3D cooperation (collaborative work); to integrate different
 computation modules (mechanical simulators, human motion, behavioural models) using high level abstractions; to automatically distribute
 computation on a network of workstations; to display results on an immersive environment (Reality Center, Workbench) or on a standard
 display. It uses Performer, OpenSG and Ogre for 3D visualization, MAX/MSP and OpenAL for sound generation, and VRPN for integration

 <td><small>The Virtual-Reality Peripheral Network (VRPN) is a set of classes within a library and a set of servers
     that are designed to implement a network-transparent interface between application programs and the set 
     of physical devices (tracker, etc.) used in a virtual-reality (VR) system. The idea is to have a PC or
     other host at each VR station that controls the peripherals (tracker, button device, haptic device,
     analog inputs, sound, etc). VRPN provides connections between the application and all of the devices
     using the appropriate class-of-service for each type of device sharing this link. The application
     remains unaware of the network topology. VRPN also provides an abstraction layer that makes all
     devices of the same base class look the same.  At the same time, it is possible for an application that requires
     access to specialized features of a certain device to derive a class that communicates with this type of device.
     The VRPN client (application-side) library has been tested on SGI/Irix, PC/Win32, PC/Cygwin, HP700/Hpux,
     Sparc/Solaris, PC/Linux, Mac/OSX, Ipaq/Linux, and Zaurus/Linux. The server-side library compiles under SGI/Irix,
     PC/Win32, and PC/Linux. VRPN support is provided in many VR frameworks. The software can be use without license fees;
     cmmercial support is available through <a href="http://www.3rdtech.com/">3rdtech</a>.
     <br><br>
     AVANGO currently has its own interfaces to physical devices. However, VRPN support could be provided at a later time.</small>

  CAVELib is a powerful application programmer interface (API) that provides the cornerstone for creating robust interactive three-dimensional
  environments. The CAVELib API provides the building blocks to handle the intricacies of creating robust applications for Virtual Environments.
  Some of the items the CAVELib abstracts away for a developer are, window and viewport creation, viewer-centered perspective calculations,
  displaying to multiple graphics channels, multi-processing and multi-threading, cluster synchronization and data sharing, and stereoscopic viewing.
  The CAVELib dramatically extends a developer's abilities to create solutions with scalable, immersive 3D representations without having
  to contend with operating system, display system, and device-level programming details. Furthermore, the CAVELib's networking capabilities
  allows collaboration, interaction and data sharing with users across the hall or around the world.   The CAVELib API is platform independent
  enabling developers to create high-end virtual reality applications on IRIX, Solaris, Windows, and Linux operating systems. 
  CAVELib-based applications are externally configurable at run-time making an application executable independent of the display system.
  Applications created with the CAVELib have the ability to run in nearly all immersive display systems.

 COVISE stands for COllaborative VIsualization and Simulation Environment. It is an extendable distributed software environment
 to integrate simulations, postprocessing and visualization functionalities in a seamless manner. From the beginning COVISE
 was designed for collaborative working allowing engineers and scientists to spread on a network infrastructure. In COVISE
 an application is divided into several processing steps, which are represented by COVISE modules. These modules, being
 implemented as separate processes, can be arbitrarily spread across different heterogeneous machine platforms.
 Major emphasis was put on the usage of high performance infrastructures such as parallel and vector computers
 and fast networks. COVISE Rendering modules support Virtual environments ranging form workbenches over powerwalls,
 curved screens up to full domes or CAVEs. The users can thus analyze their datasets intuitively in a fully immersive 
 environment through state of the art visualization techniques including Volume rendering and fast sphere rendering.
 Physical prototypes or experiments can be included into the analysis process through Augmented Reality techniques.
 COVISE is <a href="http://www.hlrs.de/organization/av/vis/covise/applications-and-users/">widely used</a> in research and industrial projects.

 The MORGAN AR/VR Framework is platform-independent, distributed, and component-based, supporting developers in
 realizing Mixed Reality prototypes and applications. MORGAN is assembled from a set of individual components
 including a render engine, external scene graph support, and access to manifold input and output devices. We further
 developed a light-weight version of MORGAN for handheld devices, such as PDAs and Smartphones, sharing most of the
 functionality and offering full runtime compatibility with MORGAN (see Figure 2). Therefore, MORGAN Light and MORGAN
 cannot only process the same scene formats, but may also be part of the same distributed application. Applications developed for
 MORGAN require no or only minimal effort to be adapted for MORGAN Light. The render engine consists of the framebuffer 
 abstraction layer for OpenGL and Direct3D and the internal scene graph. MORGAN modules also includes Marvin, a stereoscopic AR/VR viewer,
 and DEVAL, to support all input and output devices. Researchers and developers of AR/VR projects
 may license the Morgan AR/VR Framework for evaluation, development and distribution. Academic institutes and universities
 may apply for free licenses for teaching.

 <td><small>
 Avalon is an open environment for virtual and augmented reality applications. It was designed and built to serve as a platform for
 various projects and applications, both built in-house and by our project partners. The development process started at the end of 1997
 and is still ongoing. One of the main reasons to start the project was the ever present need for a faster and more efficient
 application development cycle. Therefore the goal was to define abstractions for interaction and behaviour descriptions,
 which work well for VR and AR applications. Like most traditional toolkits, Avalon uses a scene-graph to organize the data,
 as well as spatial and logical relations. In addition, a VR application needs to deal with specific behaviour of objects,
 and the user interaction via assorted input devices. The major drawback of traditional VR-toolkits is the fact that
 the application developer has to implement a controller to handle all aspects of both behaviour and interaction
 for most applications anew. To overcome this drawback, we extended the scene-graph concept of a node to a more generic component,
 which not just holds the data but defines a state, state-changes, and input/output slots for every node.
 Therefore application development is done by instantiating and connecting scene components, which are provided by the system.
 It uses OpenSG as rendering backend. In contrast to AVANGO, it does not provide a sophisticated application-level
 network distribution support.
 <br><br>
 <a name="a1"></a>Avalon, OpenSG and some other frameworks have been integrated into the <a href="http://www.instantreality.org/story/what-is-it/">instantreality
 framework</a>, a high-performance Mixed-Reality (MR) system, which combines various components to provide a single and consistent
 interface for AR/VR developers. The binary modules of the framework are available <a href="http://www.instantreality.org/downloads/">here</a>.
