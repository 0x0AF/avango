 <td><small>The Virtual-Reality Peripheral Network (VRPN) is a set of classes within a library and a set of servers
     that are designed to implement a network-transparent interface between application programs and the set 
     of physical devices (tracker, etc.) used in a virtual-reality (VR) system. The idea is to have a PC or
     other host at each VR station that controls the peripherals (tracker, button device, haptic device,
     analog inputs, sound, etc). VRPN provides connections between the application and all of the devices
     using the appropriate class-of-service for each type of device sharing this link. The application
     remains unaware of the network topology. VRPN also provides an abstraction layer that makes all
     devices of the same base class look the same.  At the same time, it is possible for an application that requires
     access to specialized features of a certain device to derive a class that communicates with this type of device.
     The VRPN client (application-side) library has been tested on SGI/Irix, PC/Win32, PC/Cygwin, HP700/Hpux,
     Sparc/Solaris, PC/Linux, Mac/OSX, Ipaq/Linux, and Zaurus/Linux. The server-side library compiles under SGI/Irix,
     PC/Win32, and PC/Linux. VRPN support is provided in many VR frameworks. The software can be use without license fees;

            and hobbyists, which proves to be helpful in mastering initial learning hurdles.
            Blender can be used for modeling, UV unwrapping, texturing, rigging, water simulations,
            skinning, animating, rendering, particle and other simulations, non-linear editing,
            compositing, and creating interactive 3D applications. Blender has a robust feature
            set similar in scope and depth to other high-end 3D software such as Softimage|XSI,
            Cinema 4D, 3ds Max, Lightwave and Maya. These features include advanced simulation
            tools such as rigid body, fluid, cloth and softbody dynamics, modifier based modeling tools,
            powerful character animation tools, and a node based material and compositing system.
            Blender uses Python as the integrated scripting language that allows extending its functionality
            and accessing most of its features through code. In addition, Blender has an integrated
            game-engine (Game Blender) that can run and export interactive content,
            and which can be scripted both in Python and through a graphical user interface.
            Blender supports three types of stereoscopic vision: side-by-side, anaglyph and vinterlace (for autostereoscopic screens).

            Kit (Croquet SDK), can be used by experienced software developers to create and deploy deeply collaborative
            multi-user online virtual world applications on and across multiple operating systems and devices.
            Derived from Squeak, the Croquet system features a peer-based messaging protocol that dramatically
            reduces the need for server infrastructures to support virtual world deployment and makes it easy
            for software developers to create deeply collaborative applications.
            Croquet has been <a href="http://www.opencroquet.org/index.php/Past_Projects#Holodeck.2FCAVE_Croquet">experimentally integrated</a> into
            the CAVE VR-environment. Croquet is available under the MIT license. Since release of the Croquet
            SDK in 2007, the SDK has not been under active development. All continued development of the technology
            has taken place under the very active Open Cobalt effort.

            Open Cobalt is a free and open source virtual workspace browser and construction toolkit

            Powered by Croquet technology, Open Cobalt uses an ordered group messaging protocol
            that provides participants with a shared, consistently replicated, real time,
            computationally dynamic set of multi-participant virtual workspaces and eliminates
            the need for virtual world servers.  It also makes it very simple to create and securely
            share deeply collaborative virtual workspaces that run on all major software operating
            systems.  Without any licensing fees, users and developers can freely build and share

 <td><small>
 <a name="c1"></a>Avalon is an open environment for virtual and augmented reality applications. It was designed and built to serve as a platform for
 various projects and applications, both built in-house and by our project partners. The development process started at the end of 1997
 and is still ongoing. One of the main reasons to start the project was the ever present need for a faster and more efficient
 application development cycle. Therefore the goal was to define abstractions for interaction and behaviour descriptions,
 which work well for VR and AR applications. Like most traditional toolkits, Avalon uses a scene-graph to organize the data,
 as well as spatial and logical relations. In addition, a VR application needs to deal with specific behaviour of objects,
 and the user interaction via assorted input devices. The major drawback of traditional VR-toolkits is the fact that
 the application developer has to implement a controller to handle all aspects of both behaviour and interaction
 for most applications anew. To overcome this drawback, we extended the scene-graph concept of a node to a more generic component,
 which not just holds the data but defines a state, state-changes, and input/output slots for every node.
 Therefore application development is done by instantiating and connecting scene components, which are provided by the system.
 It uses OpenSG as rendering backend.
 <br><br>
 <i>In contrast to AVANGO, it does not provide a sophisticated application-level
 network distribution support.</i>
 <br><br>
 <i>Avalon, OpenSG and some other frameworks have been integrated into the <a href="http://www.instantreality.org/story/what-is-it/">instantreality

  CAVELib is a powerful application programmer interface (API) that provides the cornerstone for creating robust interactive three-dimensional
  environments. The CAVELib API provides the building blocks to handle the intricacies of creating robust applications for Virtual Environments.
  Some of the items the CAVELib abstracts away for a developer are, window and viewport creation, viewer-centered perspective calculations,
  displaying to multiple graphics channels, multi-processing and multi-threading, cluster synchronization and data sharing, and stereoscopic viewing.
  The CAVELib dramatically extends a developer's abilities to create solutions with scalable, immersive 3D representations without having
  to contend with operating system, display system, and device-level programming details. Furthermore, the CAVELib's networking capabilities
  allows collaboration, interaction and data sharing with users across the hall or around the world.   The CAVELib API is platform independent
  enabling developers to create high-end virtual reality applications on IRIX, Solaris, Windows, and Linux operating systems. 
  CAVELib-based applications are externally configurable at run-time making an application executable independent of the display system.
  Applications created with the CAVELib have the ability to run in nearly all immersive display systems.

 COVISE stands for COllaborative VIsualization and Simulation Environment. It is an extendable distributed software environment
 to integrate simulations, postprocessing and visualization functionalities in a seamless manner. From the beginning COVISE
 was designed for collaborative working allowing engineers and scientists to spread on a network infrastructure. In COVISE
 an application is divided into several processing steps, which are represented by COVISE modules. These modules, being
 implemented as separate processes, can be arbitrarily spread across different heterogeneous machine platforms.
 Major emphasis was put on the usage of high performance infrastructures such as parallel and vector computers
 and fast networks. COVISE Rendering modules support Virtual environments ranging form workbenches over powerwalls,
 curved screens up to full domes or CAVEs. The users can thus analyze their datasets intuitively in a fully immersive 
 environment through state of the art visualization techniques including Volume rendering and fast sphere rendering.
 Physical prototypes or experiments can be included into the analysis process through Augmented Reality techniques.
 COVISE is <a href="http://www.hlrs.de/organization/av/vis/covise/applications-and-users/">widely used</a> in research and industrial projects.
