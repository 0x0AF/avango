<h2>Module: avango-inspector</h2>
<p>
The module "avango-inspector" provides a simple debugging tool for field containers.
</p>

<h3>Running the inspector</h3>
<p>
To use the inspector, some code must be added to your application. This code must create an Inspector object
which automatically opens a window. The inspector needs a reference to a FieldContainer, whose fields should be
displayed in this window. In the code snippet below, an object referenced by the variable "fieldcontainer" is
announced to the inspector by adding it to the Children multifield.
</p>

<pre class="snippet">
# define a field container for testing
inspector = avango.inspector.Inspector()
inspector.Children.value.append(fieldcontainer)
</pre>

<ul class="classlist">
	<li>avango.inspector.Inspector</li>
</ul>

<h3>Using the inspector</h3>
<p>
The inspector window shows a tree of FieldContainer objects with the objects in Children at the root level.
For every FieldContainer, the list of contained fields is displayed with its field name and value.
The field at the bottom of the window acts as a command line. There are two predefined objects that can be
accessed executing commands in this line: "nodes" and "field". "nodes" is the same object as the Children
multifield of the inspector. "field" is a reference to the selected field in the tree.
</p>
<p>
This tool is a work in progress. So there are some things that are not in the right shape at this time. For instance,
if you want to update the view, you have to press the "Execute" button with an empty command line. The view doesn't
update automatically.

<pre class="snippet">
# assign a new value to the Name field of the first node in the Children multifield
nodes[0].Name.value = "foo"

# assign a new value to the selected field
field.value = "bar"
</pre>
