<h1>Comparing Avango with other frameworks</h1>

The tables below describes the most popular frameworks for the development of Virtual Reality applications
and shows their relationships with Avango.

<h3>Open Source frameworks</h3>

 <td><a href="http://avango.org">Avango</a></td>
 <td><small>AVANGO is a free, cross-platform software framework designed for interactive, distributed Virtual Reality applications.
     It supports a large range of setups, ranging from desktop PCs to large-scale immersive VR installations.
     AVANGO facilitates rapid development of immersive 3D applications by offering efficient techniques for many common VR tasks.
     The key features of Avango that differentiate it from other frameworks are: easy creation and control of dynamic 3D scenes,
     scripting support, built-in multimodal interaction techniques, support for numerous interaction devices and display setups,
     possibilities to develop distributed VR applications.</small></td>

 <td>&gt300 idividual contributors </td>
 <td><a href="http://www.openscenegraph.org/projects/osg/wiki/About/Introduction">OpenSceneGraph</a></td>
 <td><small>The OpenSceneGraph is an OpenSource, cross-platform graphics toolkit for the development of high-performance
     graphics applications such as flight simulators, games, virtual reality and scientific visualization.
     It is based around the concept of a SceneGraph, providing an object-oriented framework on top of OpenGL.
     This frees the developer from implementing and optimizing low-level graphics calls and provides many additional
     utilities for rapid development of graphics applications. <br><br>
     Avango is based on OpenSceneGraph. Avango extends the functionality of OpenSceneGraph with its 
     dynamic and distributed scenes, scripting support and the support for different display systems and interaction devices</small></td>

 <td>currently supported by 2 individual developers; originated from the <a href="http://www.igd.fhg.de/">Fraunhofer IGD</a></td>
 <td><a href="http://opensg.vrsource.org/">OpenSG</a></td>
 <td><small>OpenSG is a portable scenegraph system to create realtime graphics programs, e.g. for virtual reality applications.
     It is developed following Open Source principles (LGPL) and can be used freely. It runs on Windows, Linux, Solaris
     and MacOS X and is based on OpenGL. The features that differentiate OpenSG from other scenegraphs are extensibility,
     multi-thread safety and clustering capabilities. The detailed comparison with OpenSceneGraph is available <a href="http://opensg.vrsource.org/trac/wiki/OSGComparison">here</a>.</small></td>

<tr>
 <td><a href="http://www.iastate.edu/">Iowa State University</a></td>
 <td><a href="http://www.vrjuggler.org/">VR Juggler</a></td>
 <td><small>VR Juggler is freely available open source, community-oriented virtual reality application development framework. 
It is scalable from simple desktop systems like PCs to complex multi-screen systems running on clusters
or on high-end workstations and supercomputers. The flexibility of VR Juggler allows applications
to execute in many VR system configurations including desktop VR, HMD, CAVE-like devices, and Powerwall-like devices.
The portability of the VR Juggler code ensures that any operating system can be used. VR Juggler 2.0 supports
IRIX, Linux, Windows, FreeBSD, Solaris, and Mac OS X.</small></td>

 <td><a href="http://www.isl.uiuc.edu/">University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign</a></td>
 <td><a href="http://syzygy.isl.uiuc.edu/">Syzygy</a></td>
 <td><small>Syzygy is a programming toolkit for writing virtual reality or other graphical applications to run on clusters of networked computers.
     The rendering of your virtual world is synchronized on all of the computers (to within a few milliseconds), so different screens in
     the cluster give you different simultaneous views on the virtual world. Syzygy runs on Windows, Linux, MacOS X, and Irix. Syzygy
     applications can be written in either of two programming languages: C++ or Python.</small></td>

<tr>
 <td>4 individual developers</td>
 <td><a href="http://www.ogre3d.org/about/features">Ogre3D</a></td>
 <td><small>OGRE (Object-Oriented Graphics Rendering Engine) is a scene-oriented, flexible 3D engine written in C++ designed to make
     it easier and more intuitive for developers to produce applications utilising hardware-accelerated 3D graphics.
     The class library abstracts all the details of using the underlying system libraries like Direct3D and OpenGL
     and provides an interface based on world objects and other intuitive classes. OGRE is design-led rather
     than feature-led. Every feature that goes into OGRE is considered throughly and slotted into the overall
     design as elegantly as possible and is always fully documented. It is made available under the LGPL License
     and works under Windows, Linux and Mac OSX.</small></td>
