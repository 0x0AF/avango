<h2>Writing AVANGO applications: Python</h2>

<p>Python is the scripting language for AVANGO. AVANGO allows you to build powerful AR/VR applications without having to write a single line of C++ code - most VR applications can be implemented using high-level scripting in Python only.</p>

<h4>When should I use Python?</h4>
<p>AVANGO allows VR programming in Python as well as in C++, or even mixing these laguages. We recommend using Python whenever possible. Python scripts have full access to the AVANGO runtime. AVANGO is designed to allow efficient execution of Python code. In fact, several full-featured AVANGO applications have been written without additional C++ code. There are few situations when C++ code cannot be avoided. You might have to use C++ in one of these situations:
<ul>
<li>Your application needs direct low-level hardware access</li>
<li>Your application needs access to libraries that don't offer a Python interface</li>
<li>Your application contains extensive computations that have proven to be impossible to implement in Python</li>
</ul>
In any case, it is usually good idea to start your development in Python. Only if you come across insolvable problems, you should consider re-implementation of critical parts in C++.</p>
<p>The Python programming model of AVANGO is simpler, easier to learn and more offers more efficient development. This is especially useful for beginners and for rapid prototyping applications (but, as said, not restricted to these cases).</p>
