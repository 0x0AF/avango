<h2>AVANGO Primer - Essential classes</h2>
<p>
This is a short overview of the essential classes of AVANGO.
It is not intended to be a comprehensive documentation of every class with all of its methods and behavior. For this purpose
you should consult the API reference. Because of limited time for documentation, that reference is only an auto-generated doxygen output,
at this time. So in the case you don't find the necessary information there, you have to dig into the AVANGO source-code.
</p>

<p>
The essential classes overview is the best starting point to understand programming AVANGO. It presents only the most necessary classes
for general use of the framework. Because of the modular nature of AVANGO, this overview is divided into separate sections - one for each
module. In every section, there is a short explanation of the underlying concepts and the usage. Because sometimes code is the easiest
language to describe functionality and additionally much more precise than just text, there are code snippets to show the usage of the
modules.
