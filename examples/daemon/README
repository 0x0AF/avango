This examples should show how to use the AvangoDaemon to collect input data
from an appropriate input device and use it within an Avango application.
The daemon itself runs in an own process creating threads for each configured
device.

First, execute the AvangoDaemon like this:

    python mouse-daemon.py

(Note: Make sure that all config data in mouse-daemon.py file fits to your
       local environment!)

Then execute the Avango main application:

    python mouse-app.py

The Nintendo Wiimote example works the same way, but note that you additionally
have to run a 'wminput' daemon in order to get the inputs of the Wiimote via
Linux event system (i.e. /dev/input/something).

The DTrack example should show how to configure a Avango NG DTrack device to
receive data from a DTrack tracker instance running on a dedicated MS Windows
PC collecting data from a set of ART tracking cameras.
